## Pre-requisites

This workshop assume you have the following software installed on your machine:

* NodeJS and NPM
* If using Windows as an OS, a better terminal tool. EG: https://cmder.net/

## Creating a new React App using CRA

Create React App, also known as CRA, is by far the most popular React integrated toolchain nowadays (At the time of writing this workshop). Here are a few things CRA helps software development teams with:

* Scaling to many files and components.
* Using third-party libraries from npm.
* Detecting common mistakes early.
* Live-editing CSS and JS in development.
* Optimizing the output for production.

And all of the above without requiring any configuration to get started! ðŸš€

_The info above was taken from the official ReactJS docs. For further info: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html_

So now that we've covered the basics on CRA, let's create a new React app by opening a terminal, navigating to a folder of preference and running the following:

```
npx create-react-app unit-testing-on-the-front-end-101-workshop
cd my-app
npm start
```
